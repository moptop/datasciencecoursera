## The purpose is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
## The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## You will be required to submit:
## 1) a tidy data set as described below
## 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
## 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work
##    that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
## 4) a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how
##    all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

## One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. The data
## linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the
## Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was
## obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

## Here are the data for the project: 
## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## You should create one R script called "run_analysis.R" that does the following. 
## 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
## 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (columns)
## 5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each
##    activity and each subject.
